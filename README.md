# CannaCafe

Created as my capstone project for App Academy but will one day be the official website of CannaCafe when the stars align for me to start the business ðŸ˜Š

## Documentation

As of 12/08/23 the documentation for frontend and backend need updating to accurately display routes and api. The code holds more than the documentation depicts currently.

Documentation pages/links can be found [here](https://github.com/Lillith13/CannaCafe/wiki)

## For potential employers!

The live site for this code is [here](https://cannacafe.onrender.com)
* As a heads up It's hosted on Render, free tier, so it may take a few minutes to load up (the dino servers take a bit to wake up)
