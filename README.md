## Future Plans

Implement user complaints. Similar to reviews but will be for in general complaints a member may have about anything from shipping to customer service. These will be only viewable by management staff (Managers & Owners) and the user who submitted the complaint.

Add a small dash of social media in the mix by adding the ability for users to connect/friend one another. Piggy backing off this feature will come events. Where a user can reserve for an event and upon reservation there will be a notification sent to all users that fall into a spcific categories pertaining to the event (such as "event = private, notify only friends").

Connect maps to better develop the shopping cart, takeout features, complaints, friends, and events features.

- Piggybacking off of the new connection to maps, all features will be redesigned to incorporate location. Management staff will begin to see only the complaints and reviews for the products from their specific location. Notifications will gain new filter of location. Events will get a new modifier of location and friend suggestions will become a thing.

Add user ability to DM each other

Add community forums

- Specifically for:
  - Q&As/FAQs
  - Event Planning / Event Details

Add scheduling to staff pages

- Management ability to set/edit schedules notifying all other staff at that location
- Employee ability to view schedule (their own and coworkers) and request days off

Themes

Restyling to accomodate various screen sizes and browsers

...figure out how to make this into a downloadable software and then app for mobile devices ðŸ˜Š
