On your project you requested feedback about: after adding items to the "Takeaway Bag" (TB); then clicking on the TB icon to get a listing of items in the TB; the box for removing the particular item entirely has the phrase "Remove from Cart" instead of "Remove from Takeaway Bag".(Edited)

If you are going to use "MilkShake" as one word with no space before "Shake", that's fine...but then don't capitalize Shake. Otherwise, put a space before it if you want to capitalize it.

You have two different drinks which both have the same name: "Matcha Latte".

All of the drink pictures except the "Coffee" (which probably should be labelled "Latte" as a search for such shows the same picture as a Shutterstock image; although I see from your image's URL that you got it from a NBC News article) seem to be "squat" : making them all the same size shifted their dimensions a bit.
- (Sorry, the above "squat" comment just applies to the "List" view, not the "Tile" view.)
- (And the same for the Merchandise: in Tile view it all looks fine, but some of them are "squat" in List view.)

I think you want "Acapulco" without the first l you have in "Alcapulco Gold"
