Firstly Krystina Bell beautiful work done. The first baby step is loving. Talking about user perspective: A user will visit and spend hardly 2-3 seconds at first sight there is where you need to gain trust. Cut down your emotions in one liner on the home page . Also to navigate to other pages give some meaningful text or give beautiful buttons . From a dev perspective the code should work platform independent so need to play with frontend skills so that it stays with the same feeling on every platform like web , Android, iOS etc . Just observe the icons to stand out from the crowd and you can find icons which match your intent. There are lots of things that will come in future as your idea keeps evolving like storing data making it flow to frontend etc . But you rocked the first step! Cheers!!
