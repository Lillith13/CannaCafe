On the first page after clicking to enter, the console has the issue "A form field element has neither an id nor a name attribute. This might prevent the browser from correctly autofilling the form." Also what looks to be some issues with promises.

Entering the food and drink sections: two errors on get fetches to the favorites and wishlist.

On changing color themes, it seems to take a while to reload and there are some Quill issues (I'm unfamiliar with Quill so it might be normal)
